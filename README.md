# The Beginner's Guide to eBPF

_My report "What is eBPF?" and in-depth book "Learning eBPF" are both available for [download from Isovalent](https://isovalent.com/ebpf/) or with your subscription to [O'Reilly's learning platform](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-ebpf/9781492097266/). You can buy "Learning eBPF" from any good bookstore (support your local bookshop by ordering it there!)_

Several presentations and repos that help you get started with eBPF programming
